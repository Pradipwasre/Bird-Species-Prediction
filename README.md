# Bird-Species-Prediction

In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict species of the bird. We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this multiclass classifictaion model. We will be using keras for this project.

# Scope:

This project can be used for educational purposes to get a better understanding of how to create network architecture for a CNN model. You can further hyper parameter tune this model to reach a higher accuracy. It can be used by bird sanctuaries to identify different types of birds.
